# Corpus
#### A collection of CSS things

Corpus is yet another CSS toolkit. It’s basically a collection of the things I find [myself](http://jamiewilson.io) returning to for each new project. It uses [Flexbox](http://tympanus.net/codrops/css_reference/flexbox/) for the grid system, [viewport-based heights and percentage-based widths](http://bitsofco.de/2015/viewport-vs-percentage-units/), is heavily influenced by Basscss’s [White Space](http://www.basscss.com/docs/white-space/) module, and has a few useful greyscale color utilities. For syntax highlighting I'm using [Prism.js](http://prismjs.com/) and my own [Predawn](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Predawn) color scheme, with code set in [Office Code Pro](https://github.com/nathco/Office-Code-Pro). Styles are written in SCSS.
